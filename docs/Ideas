#CS411 Project Ideas

Restaurant and Transportation Business Levels
  Use "populartimes" API to get real-time data on how many people are at a location.
  Also use a maps/business finder API to search for venues.
  
Snow Day Forecaster
  Create a web application which allows users to predict wether their school will 
  close due to snow. This is a common phenomenon accross New England where students 
  get very excited about the prospect of school getting cancelled and go to all kinds 
  of platforms to deliberate, debate and gain insite as to what their schools decsision will be.
  Students generate so much excitement around snow days that application have been created 
  to "predict" how likely a students school will be closed. Unfortinatly these applications 
  are either paid or just not good. So there is an oppurtinuity to get it right and give 
  students a free and reliable tool which they can (almost) depend on when deciding if they 
  should do their homework the night before a snow storm or not. 
  
  The web application would utilize a Weather data API to collect relevent weather data for 
  the prediction model, as well as a local school listing API to generate snow day prediction 
  for a spoecific school.
  
Tradeing App for College Students
  Payment API
  Market item lookup for comparable prices
